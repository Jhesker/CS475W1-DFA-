# CS475W1-DFA-
Week one of 475 course. DFA assignment
The primary goal of these uploads over the next several weeks is to not only keep track of my work
but to get as much experience with GitHub as possible. Please feel free to ask me any questions or 
provide me with any feedback or suggestions. I will try to include each of the assignment prompts 
so it is easy to understand the format that the text files need to test the program. 
This will also give you at least a little bit of an idea as to what is going on before you dive into the code.   

Note- see DFA prompt.

Need to work on efficiency of DFA... Convert nested loop implimentation of the run() method to impliment a much more efficient 
hashmap Takes O(n^2) runtime to O(n) best case for hashmap O(1)
